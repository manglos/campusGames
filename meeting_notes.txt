Extra Credit:
                Get started researching how to implement GPS.


02-04-13

1) How do we prevent this app from being used to stalk people?
                Proposed Solution: We could use  a system of invitations, and stop tracking when someone leaves the game.
                Extra Credit: If you think of a better way of handling the issue, please let us know!

2) Should we have multiple games in the same app, or should we have a number of apps in the "Campus Games" series?
                We did not decide on this, so think it over. We will revisit this in a future meeting.

3) Should we skip the meeting on Wednesday?
                This was proposed after the meeting, since we are ahead of the game, and might not have much to discuss.
                Please respond with your answer (if you would like to skip the meeting on Wednesday or not) ASAP.
                If everyone agrees we can skip it, we will meet on Friday, otherwise we will meet on Wednesday, as usual.
